# Movie-Recommendation-System
This repository contains a basic movie recommendation system implemented in Python using Pandas. The system suggests movies that are most similar to a user's choice based on item similarity.
# Overview
A movie recommendation system suggests movies to users based on their preferences or similarities with other movies they liked. This system uses two common approaches:

1] Content-Based Filtering: Recommends movies that are similar to a particular movie based on various attributes (like genre, director, actors).

2] Collaborative Filtering: Builds a model from user ratings and recommends movies based on similar users' preferences.

In this repository, we focus on Content-Based Filtering to recommend movies similar to a user's choice.
